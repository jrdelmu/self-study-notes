## Render HTML Elements to the DOM

ReactDOM offers a simple method to render React elements to the DOM which looks like this: `ReactDOM.render(componentToRender, targetNode)`.

example: 

```
There is a div with id='challenge-node' available for you to use.

const JSX = (
  <div>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>Lets render this to the DOM</p>
  </div>
);
// Change code below this line
ReactDOM.render(JSX, document.getElementById('challenge-node')) <--- RENDERING HERE
```

## Create a Stateless Functional Component

There are two ways to create a React component. The first way is to use a JavaScript function. Defining a component in this way creates a stateless functional component.

example:

```
const MyComponent = function() {
  return(
    <div>Hello World</div>
  )
}
```

## Create a React Component

The other way to define a React component is with the ES6 class syntax. In the following example, Kitten extends React.Component:

```
class Kitten extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <h1>Hi</h1>
    );
  }
}
```

This creates an ES6 class Kitten which extends the React.Component class. So the Kitten class now has access to many useful React features, such as local state and lifecycle hooks. Don't worry if you aren't familiar with these terms yet, they will be covered in greater detail in later challenges. Also notice the Kitten class has a constructor defined within it that calls super(). It uses super() to call the constructor of the parent class, in this case React.Component. The constructor is a special method used during the initialization of objects that are created with the class keyword. It is best practice to call a component's constructor with super, and pass props to both. This makes sure the component is initialized properly.

## Use Default Props

React also has an option to set default props. You can assign default props to a component as a property on the component itself and React assigns the default prop if necessary. This allows you to specify what a prop value should be if no value is explicitly provided.

example:

```
const ShoppingCart = (props) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Shopping Cart Component</h1>
    </div>
  )
};

ShoppingCart.defaultProps = {items: 0} <--- DEFAULT HERE
```

## Use PropTypes to Define the Props You ExpectPassed

React provides useful type-checking features to verify that components receive props of the correct type. It's considered a best practice to set propTypes when you know the type of a prop ahead of time. You can define a propTypes property for a component in the same way you defined defaultProps. Doing this will check that props of a given key are present with a given type.

```
const Items = (props) => {
  return <h1>Current Quantity of Items in Cart: {props.quantity}</h1>
};

// Change code below this line
  Items.propTypes = {quantity: PropTypes.number.isRequired} <--- PROPTYPE HERE
// Change code above this line

Items.defaultProps = {
  quantity: 0
};

class ShoppingCart extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return <Items />
  }
};
```

## Pass Props to a Stateless Functional Component

In React, you can pass props, or properties, to child components. Say you have an App component which renders a child component called Welcome which is a stateless functional component.

```

CHILD COMPONENT:
const CurrentDate = (props) => {
  return (
    <div>
      { /* Change code below this line */ }
      <p>The current date is:{props.date} </p>
      { /* Change code above this line */ }
    </div>
  );
};

PARENT COMPONENT:
class Calendar extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h3>What date is it?</h3>
        { /* Change code below this line */ }
        <CurrentDate date={Date()}/>
        { /* Change code above this line */ }
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```

## Access Props Using this.props

Anytime you refer to a class component within itself, you use the `this` keyword. To access props within a class component, you preface the code that you use to access it with `this`.

```
CHILD COMPONENT:
class ReturnTempPassword extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
console.log(props) <--- this console log will return: {tempPassword: 'qwerty'}
  }
  render() {
    
    return (
      
        <div>
            { /* Change code below this line */ }
            <p>Your temporary password is: <strong>{this.props.tempPassword}</strong></p>
            
            { /* Change code above this line */ }
        </div>
    );
  }
};

PARENT COMPONENT: 
class ResetPassword extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

  }
  render() {
    return (
        <div>
          <h2>Reset Password</h2>
          <h3>We've generated a new temporary password for you.</h3>
          <h3>Please reset this password from your account settings ASAP.</h3>
          { /* Change code below this line */ }
          <ReturnTempPassword tempPassword='qwerty'/>
          { /* Change code above this line */ }
        </div>
    );
  }
};

```

`props` returns an object: `{tempPassword: 'qwerty'}`. In order to access this object dot notation is used: `props.tempPassword` = 'qwerty'.

### Review

```
PARENT COMPONENT:
class CampSite extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <Camper/> <--- CHILD COMPONENT
      </div>
    );
  }
};
// Change code below this line

CHILD COMPONENT:
const Camper = (props) =>{
  return(
    <p>{props.name}</p>
  )
}

Camper.defaultProps= {name: 'CamperBot'} <--- DEFAULT

Camper.propTypes={name:PropTypes.string.isRequired} <--- PROPTYPE 
```

## Create a Stateful Component

You create state in a React component by declaring a state property on the component class in its constructor. This initializes the component with state when it is created. The state property must be set to a JavaScript object.

You have access to the state object throughout the life of your component. You can update it, render it in your UI, and pass it as props to child components. The state object can be as complex or as simple as you need it to be. Note that you must create a class component by extending React.Component in order to create state like this.

```
class StatefulComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    // Only change code below this line
  this.state={
    name: 'Jovincent Del Mundo'
  }
    // Only change code above this line
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>{this.state.name}</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
};      
```

## Render State in the User Interface

Once you define a component's initial state, you can display any part of it in the UI that is rendered. If a component is stateful, it will always have access to the data in state in its render() method. You can access the data with this.state.

If you want to access a state value within the return of the render method, you have to enclose the value in curly braces.

```
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      name: 'freeCodeCamp'
    }
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        { /* Change code below this line */ }
        <h1>{this.state.name}</h1>
        { /* Change code above this line */ }
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```

## Render State in the User Interface Another Way

There is another way to access state in a component. In the render() method, before the return statement, you can write JavaScript directly. For example, you could declare functions, access data from state or props, perform computations on this data, and so on. Then, you can assign any data to variables, which you have access to in the return statement.

```
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      name: 'freeCodeCamp'
    }
  }
  render() {
    // Change code below this line
      const name = this.state.name <--- DECLARING VARIABLE HERE
    // Change code above this line
    return (
      <div>
        { /* Change code below this line */ }
          <h1>{name}</h1> <--- USING VARIABLE HERE 
        { /* Change code above this line */ }
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```

## Set State with this.setState

There is also a way to change the component's state. React provides a method for updating component `state` called `setState`. You call the `setState` method within your component class like so: `this.setState()`, passing in an object with key-value pairs. The keys are your state properties and the values are the updated state data. 

React expects you to never modify state directly, instead always use this.setState() when state changes occur. Also, you should note that React may batch multiple state updates in order to improve performance. What this means is that state updates through the setState method can be asynchronous. There is an alternative syntax for the setState method which provides a way around this problem.

```
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      name: 'Initial State'
    };
    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
  }
  handleClick() {
    // Change code below this line
    this.setState({ <--- SETTING STATE HERE
      name: 'React Rocks!'
    })
    // Change code above this line
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click Me</button>
        <h1>{this.state.name}</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```

## Bind 'this' to a Class Method

Refer to this [guide]{https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/this-is-why-we-need-to-bind-event-handlers-in-class-components-in-react/189331}

In addition to setting and updating state, you can also define methods for your component class. A class method typically needs to use the this keyword so it can access properties on the class (such as state and props) inside the scope of the method. There are a few ways to allow your class methods to access this.

One common way is to explicitly bind this in the constructor so this becomes bound to the class methods when the component is initialized. You may have noticed the last challenge used this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this) for its handleClick method in the constructor. Then, when you call a function like this.setState() within your class method, this refers to the class and will not be undefined.

```
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      text: "Hello"
    };
    // Change code below this line
      this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this)
    // Change code above this line
  }
  handleClick() {
    this.setState({
      text: "You clicked!"
    });
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        { /* Change code below this line */ }
        <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click Me</button>
        { /* Change code above this line */ }
        <h1>{this.state.text}</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```

### bind

```
const module = {
  x: 42,
  getX: function() {
    return this.x;
  }
};

const unboundGetX = module.getX;
console.log(unboundGetX()); // The function gets invoked at the global scope
// expected output: undefined

const boundGetX = unboundGetX.bind(module);
console.log(boundGetX());
// expected output: 42
```

## Use State to Toggle an Element

Sometimes you might need to know the previous state when updating the state. However, state updates may be asynchronous - this means React may batch multiple setState() calls into a single update. This means you can't rely on the previous value of this.state or this.props when calculating the next value. So, you should not use code like this:

```
this.setState({
  counter: this.state.counter + this.props.increment
});
```

Instead, you should pass setState a function that allows you to access state and props. Using a function with setState guarantees you are working with the most current values of state and props. This means that the above should be rewritten as:

```
this.setState((state, props) => ({
  counter: state.counter + props.increment
}));
```
You can also use a form without props if you need only the state:

```
this.setState(state => ({
  counter: state.counter + 1
}));
```

example:
```
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      visibility: false
    };
    // Change code below this line
      this.toggleVisibility = this.toggleVisibility.bind(this)
    // Change code above this line
  }
  // Change code below this line
  toggleVisibility() {
    this.setState(state => {
      if(state.visibility === true){
        return {visibility: false}
      }else{
        return {visibility: true}
      }
    })
  }
  // Change code above this line
  render() {
    if (this.state.visibility) {
      return (
        <div>
          <button onClick={this.toggleVisibility}>Click Me</button>
          <h1>Now you see me!</h1>
        </div>
      );
    } else {
      return (
        <div>
          <button onClick={this.toggleVisibility}>Click Me</button>
        </div>
      );
    }
  }
}
```
**Aleternate solution**
```
  toggleVisibility() {
    this.setState(state => ({
      visibility: !state.visibility
    }));
  }
```


**NOTE**: The interpreter considers the { after => to be the start of a function block, rather than an object - so, wrap it in parentheses to make it clear that you're returning an object there, rather than defining a function.

## Create a Controlled Input

Your application may have more complex interactions between state and the rendered UI. For example, form control elements for text input, such as input and textarea, maintain their own state in the DOM as the user types. With React, you can move this mutable state into a React component's state. The user's input becomes part of the application state, so React controls the value of that input field. Typically, if you have React components with input fields the user can type into, it will be a controlled input form.

```
class ControlledInput extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      input: ''
    };
    // Change code below this line
    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this)
    // Change code above this line
  }
  // Change code below this line
  handleChange(event) {
    this.setState({input: event.target.value})
  }
  // Change code above this line
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        { /* Change code below this line */}
        <input value={this.state.input} onChange={this.handleChange}/>
        { /* Change code above this line */}
        <h4>Controlled Input:</h4>
        <p>{this.state.input}</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```

## Create a Controlled Form

The last challenge showed that React can control the internal state for certain elements like input and textarea, which makes them controlled components. This applies to other form elements as well, including the regular HTML form element.

```
class MyForm extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      input: '',
      submit: ''
    };
    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);
  }
  handleChange(event) {
    this.setState({
      input: event.target.value
    });
  }
  handleSubmit(event) {
    // Change code below this line
    event.preventDefault()
    this.setState({
      submit: this.state.input
    })
    // Change code above this line
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
          {/* Change code below this line */}
          <input value={this.state.input} onChange={this.handleChange}/>
          {/* Change code above this line */}
          <button type='submit'>Submit!</button>
        </form>
        {/* Change code below this line */}
        <h1>{this.state.submit}</h1>
        {/* Change code above this line */}
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

## Pass State as Props to Child Components

You saw a lot of examples that passed props to child JSX elements and child React components in previous challenges. You may be wondering where those props come from. A common pattern is to have a stateful component containing the state important to your app, that then renders child components. You want these components to have access to some pieces of that state, which are passed in as props.

For example, maybe you have an App component that renders a Navbar, among other components. In your App, you have state that contains a lot of user information, but the Navbar only needs access to the user's username so it can display it. You pass that piece of state to the Navbar component as a prop.

This pattern illustrates some important paradigms in React. The first is unidirectional data flow. State flows in one direction down the tree of your application's components, from the stateful parent component to child components. The child components only receive the state data they need. The second is that complex stateful apps can be broken down into just a few, or maybe a single, stateful component. The rest of your components simply receive state from the parent as props, and render a UI from that state. It begins to create a separation where state management is handled in one part of code and UI rendering in another. This principle of separating state logic from UI logic is one of React's key principles. When it's used correctly, it makes the design of complex, stateful applications much easier to manage.

```
class MyApp extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      name: 'CamperBot'
    }
  }
  render() {
    return (
       <div>
         {/* Change code below this line */}
         <Navbar name={this.state.name}/>
         {/* Change code above this line */}
       </div>
    );
  }
};

class Navbar extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    console.log(props)
  }
  render() {
    return (
    <div>
      {/* Change code below this line */}
      <h1>Hello, my name is: {this.props.name} </h1>
      {/* Change code above this line */}
    </div>
    );
  }
};
```

## Pass a Callback as Props

You can pass state as props to child components, but you're not limited to passing data. You can also pass handler functions or any method that's defined on a React component to a child component. This is how you allow child components to interact with their parent components. You pass methods to a child just like a regular prop. It's assigned a name and you have access to that method name under this.props in the child component.

```
class MyApp extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      inputValue: ''
    }
    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
  }
  handleChange(event) {
    this.setState({
      inputValue: event.target.value
    });
    console.log('1',this.props)
  }
  render() {
    return (
       <div>
        { /* Change code below this line */ }
        <GetInput input={this.state.inputValue} handleChange={this.handleChange}/>
        <RenderInput input={this.state.inputValue}/>
        { /* Change code above this line */ }
       </div>
    );
  }
};

class GetInput extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    console.log('2', this.props)
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h3>Get Input:</h3>
        <input
          value={this.props.input}
          onChange={this.props.handleChange}/>
      </div>
    );
  }
};

class RenderInput extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    console.log('3', this.props)
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h3>Input Render:</h3>
        <p>{this.props.input}</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```

## Use the Lifecycle Method componentWillMount

React components have several special methods that provide opportunities to perform actions at specific points in the lifecycle of a component. These are called lifecycle methods, or lifecycle hooks, and allow you to catch components at certain points in time. This can be before they are rendered, before they update, before they receive props, before they unmount, and so on. Here is a list of some of the main lifecycle methods: componentWillMount() componentDidMount() shouldComponentUpdate() componentDidUpdate() componentWillUnmount() The next several lessons will cover some of the basic use cases for these lifecycle methods.

```
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  componentWillMount() {
    // Change code below this line
    console.log('hello')
    // Change code above this line
  }
  render() {
    return <div />
  }
};
```

## Use the Lifecycle Method componentDidMount

Most web developers, at some point, need to call an API endpoint to retrieve data. If you're working with React, it's important to know where to perform this action.

The best practice with React is to place API calls or any calls to your server in the lifecycle method componentDidMount(). This method is called after a component is mounted to the DOM. Any calls to setState() here will trigger a re-rendering of your component. When you call an API in this method, and set your state with the data that the API returns, it will automatically trigger an update once you receive the data.

```
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      activeUsers: null
    };
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    setTimeout(() => {
      this.setState({
        activeUsers: 1273
      });
    }, 2500);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        {/* Change code below this line */}
        <h1>Active Users: {this.state.activeUsers}</h1>
        {/* Change code above this line */}
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

## Add Event Listener

The componentDidMount() method is also the best place to attach any event listeners you need to add for specific functionality. React provides a synthetic event system which wraps the native event system present in browsers. This means that the synthetic event system behaves exactly the same regardless of the user's browser - even if the native events may behave differently between different browsers.

You've already been using some of these synthetic event handlers such as onClick(). React's synthetic event system is great to use for most interactions you'll manage on DOM elements. However, if you want to attach an event handler to the document or window objects, you have to do this directly.

[document.addEventListener]('https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_document_addeventlistener.asp')

```
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      message: ''
    };
    this.handleEnter = this.handleEnter.bind(this);
    this.handleKeyPress = this.handleKeyPress.bind(this);
  }
  // Change code below this line
  componentDidMount() {
    // console.log('component did mount')
   document.addEventListener('keydown', this.handleKeyPress)
  }
  componentWillUnmount() {
    // console.log('component will unmount')
    document.removeEventListener('keydown', this.handleKeyPress)
  }
  // Change code above this line
  handleEnter() {
    // THIS HAPPENS SECOND
    this.setState((state) => ({
      message: state.message + 'You pressed the enter key! '
    }));
  }
  handleKeyPress(event) {
    // THIS HAPPENS FIRST
    if (event.keyCode === 13) {
      this.handleEnter();
    }
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>{this.state.message}</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```

## Optimize Re-Renders with shouldComponentUpdate

So far, if any component receives new state or new props, it re-renders itself and all its children. This is usually okay. But React provides a lifecycle method you can call when child components receive new state or props, and declare specifically if the components should update or not. The method is shouldComponentUpdate(), and it takes nextProps and nextState as parameters.

This method is a useful way to optimize performance. For example, the default behavior is that your component re-renders when it receives new props, even if the props haven't changed. You can use shouldComponentUpdate() to prevent this by comparing the props. The method must return a boolean value that tells React whether or not to update the component. You can compare the current props (this.props) to the next props (nextProps) to determine if you need to update or not, and return true or false accordingly.

```
class OnlyEvens extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {
    console.log('Should I update?');
    console.log(nextProps, nextProps.value, ',next props')
    // Change code below this line l
    if(nextProps.value % 2 === 0){
      return true
    } else {
      return false
    }
    // Change code above this line 
  }
  componentDidUpdate() {
    console.log('Component re-rendered.');
    console.log(this.props,',next props')
    console.log(this.state, ',next state')
  }
  render() {
    return <h1>{this.props.value}</h1>;
  }
}

class Controller extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      value: 0
    };
    this.addValue = this.addValue.bind(this);
  }
  addValue() {
    this.setState(state => ({
      value: state.value + 1
    }));
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <button onClick={this.addValue}>Add</button>
        <OnlyEvens value={this.state.value} />
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```
## Introducing Inline StylesPassed

There are other complex concepts that add powerful capabilities to your React code. But you may be wondering about the more simple problem of how to style those JSX elements you create in React. You likely know that it won't be exactly the same as working with HTML because of the way you apply classes to JSX elements.

If you import styles from a stylesheet, it isn't much different at all. You apply a class to your JSX element using the className attribute, and apply styles to the class in your stylesheet. Another option is to apply inline styles, which are very common in ReactJS development.

You apply inline styles to JSX elements similar to how you do it in HTML, but with a few JSX differences. Here's an example of an inline style in HTML:

`<div style="color: yellow; font-size: 16px">Mellow Yellow</div>`
JSX elements use the style attribute, but because of the way JSX is transpiled, you can't set the value to a string. Instead, you set it equal to a JavaScript object. Here's an example:

`<div style={{color: "yellow", fontSize: 16}}>Mellow Yellow</div>`
Notice how we camelCase the fontSize property? This is because React will not accept kebab-case keys in the style object. React will apply the correct property name for us in the HTML.

```
class Colorful extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div style ={{color:'red', fontSize: 72}}>Big Red</div>
    );
  }
};
```

## Add Inline Styles in React

You may have noticed in the last challenge that there were several other syntax differences from HTML inline styles in addition to the style attribute set to a JavaScript object. First, the names of certain CSS style properties use camel case. For example, the last challenge set the size of the font with fontSize instead of font-size. Hyphenated words like font-size are invalid syntax for JavaScript object properties, so React uses camel case. As a rule, any hyphenated style properties are written using camel case in JSX.

All property value length units (like height, width, and fontSize) are assumed to be in px unless otherwise specified. If you want to use em, for example, you wrap the value and the units in quotes, like `{fontSize: "4em"}`. Other than the length values that default to px, all other property values should be wrapped in quotes.

```
const styles = {
  color: 'purple',
  fontSize: 40,
  border: '2px solid purple',
}
// Change code above this line
class Colorful extends React.Component {
  render() {
    // Change code below this line
    return (
      <div style={styles}>Style Me!</div>
    );
    // Change code above this line
  }
};
```

## Use Advanced JavaScript in React Render Method

In previous challenges, you learned how to inject JavaScript code into JSX code using curly braces, { }, for tasks like accessing props, passing props, accessing state, inserting comments into your code, and most recently, styling your components. These are all common use cases to put JavaScript in JSX, but they aren't the only way that you can utilize JavaScript code in your React components.

You can also write JavaScript directly in your render methods, before the return statement, without inserting it inside of curly braces. This is because it is not yet within the JSX code. When you want to use a variable later in the JSX code inside the return statement, you place the variable name inside curly braces.

```
const inputStyle = {
  width: 235,
  margin: 5
};

class MagicEightBall extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      userInput: '',
      randomIndex: ''
    };
    this.ask = this.ask.bind(this);
    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
  }
  ask() {
    if (this.state.userInput) {
      this.setState({
        randomIndex: Math.floor(Math.random() * 20),
        userInput: ''
      });
    }
  }
  handleChange(event) {
    this.setState({
      userInput: event.target.value
    });
  }
  render() {
    console.log(this.state.randomIndex)
    const possibleAnswers = [
      'It is certain',
      'It is decidedly so',
      'Without a doubt',
      'Yes, definitely',
      'You may rely on it',
      'As I see it, yes',
      'Outlook good',
      'Yes',
      'Signs point to yes',
      'Reply hazy try again',
      'Ask again later',
      'Better not tell you now',
      'Cannot predict now',
      'Concentrate and ask again',
      "Don't count on it",
      'My reply is no',
      'My sources say no',
      'Most likely',
      'Outlook not so good',
      'Very doubtful'
    ];
    const answer = possibleAnswers[this.state.randomIndex]; // Change this line
    console.log()
    return (
      <div>
        <input
          type='text'
          value={this.state.userInput}
          onChange={this.handleChange}
          style={inputStyle}
        />
        <br />
        <button onClick={this.ask}>Ask the Magic Eight Ball!</button>
        <br />
        <h3>Answer:</h3>
        <p>
          {/* Change code below this line */}
          {answer}
          {/* Change code above this line */}
        </p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

## Render with an If-Else Condition

Another application of using JavaScript to control your rendered view is to tie the elements that are rendered to a condition. When the condition is true, one view renders. When it's false, it's a different view. You can do this with a standard if/else statement in the render() method of a React component.

```
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      display: true
    }
    this.toggleDisplay = this.toggleDisplay.bind(this);
  }
  toggleDisplay() {
    this.setState((state) => ({
      display: !state.display
    }));
  }
  render() {
    // Change code below this line
    console.log(this.state.display)
    const displayBool = this.state.display
    if(displayBool === false){
      return(
        <div>
          <button onClick={this.toggleDisplay}>Toggle Display</button>
        </div>
      )
    }else{
    return (
       <div>
         <button onClick={this.toggleDisplay}>Toggle Display</button>
         <h1>Displayed!</h1>
       </div>
      );
    }
  };
}
```

## Use && for a More Concise Conditional

The if/else statements worked in the last challenge, but there's a more concise way to achieve the same result. Imagine that you are tracking several conditions in a component and you want different elements to render depending on each of these conditions. If you write a lot of else if statements to return slightly different UIs, you may repeat code which leaves room for error. Instead, you can use the && logical operator to perform conditional logic in a more concise way. This is possible because you want to check if a condition is true, and if it is, return some markup. Here's an example:

`{condition && <p>markup</p>}`
If the condition is true, the markup will be returned. If the condition is false, the operation will immediately return false after evaluating the condition and return nothing. You can include these statements directly in your JSX and string multiple conditions together by writing && after each one. This allows you to handle more complex conditional logic in your render() method without repeating a lot of code.

```
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      display: true
    }
    this.toggleDisplay = this.toggleDisplay.bind(this);
  }
  toggleDisplay() {
    this.setState(state => ({
      display: !state.display
    }));
  }
  render() {
    // Change code below this line
    console.log(this.state.display)
    const displayBool = this.state.display
    return (
       <div>
         <button onClick={this.toggleDisplay}>Toggle Display</button>
         {displayBool && <h1>Displayed!</h1>}
       </div>
    );
  }
};
```

## Use a Ternary Expression for Conditional Rendering

xBefore moving on to dynamic rendering techniques, there's one last way to use built-in JavaScript conditionals to render what you want: the ternary operator. The ternary operator is often utilized as a shortcut for if/else statements in JavaScript. They're not quite as robust as traditional if/else statements, but they are very popular among React developers. One reason for this is because of how JSX is compiled, if/else statements can't be inserted directly into JSX code. You might have noticed this a couple challenges ago — when an if/else statement was required, it was always outside the return statement. Ternary expressions can be an excellent alternative if you want to implement conditional logic within your JSX. Recall that a ternary operator has three parts, but you can combine several ternary expressions together. Here's the basic syntax:

`condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse`

```
const inputStyle = {
  width: 235,
  margin: 5
};

class CheckUserAge extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    // Change code below this line
      this.state = {
        input: '',
        userAge: ''
      }
    // Change code above this line
    this.submit = this.submit.bind(this);
    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
  }
  handleChange(e) {
    this.setState({
      input: e.target.value,
      userAge: ''
    });
  }
  submit() {
    this.setState(state => ({
      userAge: state.input
    }));
  }
  render() {
    const buttonOne = <button onClick={this.submit}>Submit</button>;
    const buttonTwo = <button>You May Enter</button>;
    const buttonThree = <button>You Shall Not Pass</button>;
    return (
      <div>
        <h3>Enter Your Age to Continue</h3>
        <input
          style={inputStyle}
          type='number'
          value={this.state.input}
          onChange={this.handleChange}
        />
        <br />
        {/* Change code below this line */}
          {
            this.state.userAge === '' 
            ? buttonOne 
            : this.state.userAge >= 18 
              ? buttonTwo 
              : buttonThree}
        {/* Change code above this line */}
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

## Render Conditionally from Props

So far, you've seen how to use if/else, &&, and the ternary operator (condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse) to make conditional decisions about what to render and when. However, there's one important topic left to discuss that lets you combine any or all of these concepts with another powerful React feature: props. Using props to conditionally render code is very common with React developers — that is, they use the value of a given prop to automatically make decisions about what to render.

In this challenge, you'll set up a child component to make rendering decisions based on props. You'll also use the ternary operator, but you can see how several of the other concepts that were covered in the last few challenges might be just as useful in this context.

```
class Results extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    {/* Change code below this line */}
    return <h1>{this.props.fiftyFifty ? 'You Win!' : 'You Lose!'}</h1>;
    {/* Change code above this line */}
  }
}

class GameOfChance extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      counter: 1
    };
    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
  }
  handleClick() {
    this.setState({
      // Complete the return statement:
      counter: this.state.counter + 1
    });
  }
  render() {
    const expression = Math.random() >= .5; 
    return (
      <div>
        <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Play Again</button>
        {/* Change code below this line */}
          <Results fiftyFifty = {expression}/>
        {/* Change code above this line */}
        <p>{'Turn: ' + this.state.counter}</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

## Change Inline CSS Conditionally Based on Component State

At this point, you've seen several applications of conditional rendering and the use of inline styles. Here's one more example that combines both of these topics. You can also render CSS conditionally based on the state of a React component. To do this, you check for a condition, and if that condition is met, you modify the styles object that's assigned to the JSX elements in the render method.

This paradigm is important to understand because it is a dramatic shift from the more traditional approach of applying styles by modifying DOM elements directly (which is very common with jQuery, for example). In that approach, you must keep track of when elements change and also handle the actual manipulation directly. It can become difficult to keep track of changes, potentially making your UI unpredictable. When you set a style object based on a condition, you describe how the UI should look as a function of the application's state. There is a clear flow of information that only moves in one direction. This is the preferred method when writing applications with React.

```
class GateKeeper extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      input: ''
    };
    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
  }
  handleChange(event) {
    this.setState({ input: event.target.value })
  }
  render() {
    let inputStyle = {
      border: '1px solid black'
    };
    // Change code below this line
    if(this.state.input.length > 15){
      inputStyle = {
        border: '3px solid red'
      }
    }
    // Change code above this line
    return (
      <div>
        <h3>Don't Type Too Much:</h3>
        <input
          type="text"
          style={inputStyle}
          value={this.state.input}
          onChange={this.handleChange} />
      </div>
    );
  }
};
```

## Use Array.map() to Dynamically Render Elements

Conditional rendering is useful, but you may need your components to render an unknown number of elements. Often in reactive programming, a programmer has no way to know what the state of an application is until runtime, because so much depends on a user's interaction with that program. Programmers need to write their code to correctly handle that unknown state ahead of time. Using Array.map() in React illustrates this concept.

For example, you create a simple "To Do List" app. As the programmer, you have no way of knowing how many items a user might have on their list. You need to set up your component to dynamically render the correct number of list elements long before someone using the program decides that today is laundry day.

```
const textAreaStyles = {
  width: 235,
  margin: 5
};

class MyToDoList extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    // Change code below this line
      this.state = {
        userInput : '',
        toDoList : []
      }
    // Change code above this line
    this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);
    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
  }
  handleSubmit() {
    const itemsArray = this.state.userInput.split(',');
    this.setState({
      toDoList: itemsArray
    });
  }
  handleChange(e) {
    this.setState({
      userInput: e.target.value
    });
  }
  render() {
    const items = this.state.toDoList.map(function(items){
      console.log(items);
      return <li>{items}</li>;
    });
    console.log(items)
    return (
      <div>
        <textarea
          onChange={this.handleChange}
          value={this.state.userInput}
          style={textAreaStyles}
          placeholder='Separate Items With Commas'
        />
        <br />
        <button onClick={this.handleSubmit}>Create List</button>
        <h1>My "To Do" List:</h1>
        <ul>{items}</ul>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

## Give Sibling Elements a Unique Key Attribute

The last challenge showed how the map method is used to dynamically render a number of elements based on user input. However, there was an important piece missing from that example. When you create an array of elements, each one needs a key attribute set to a unique value. React uses these keys to keep track of which items are added, changed, or removed. This helps make the re-rendering process more efficient when the list is modified in any way.

Note: Keys only need to be unique between sibling elements, they don't need to be globally unique in your application.

```
const frontEndFrameworks = [
  'React',
  'Angular',
  'Ember',
  'Knockout',
  'Backbone',
  'Vue'
];

function Frameworks() {
  const renderFrameworks = frontEndFrameworks.map(function(i){
    return <li key = {i}>{i}</li>
  })
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Popular Front End JavaScript Frameworks</h1>
      <ul>
        {renderFrameworks}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Use Array.filter() to Dynamically Filter an Array

The map array method is a powerful tool that you will use often when working with React. Another method related to map is filter, which filters the contents of an array based on a condition, then returns a new array. For example, if you have an array of users that all have a property online which can be set to true or false, you can filter only those users that are online by writing:

`let onlineUsers = users.filter(user => user.online);`

```
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      users: [
        {
          username: 'Jeff',
          online: true
        },
        {
          username: 'Alan',
          online: false
        },
        {
          username: 'Mary',
          online: true
        },
        {
          username: 'Jim',
          online: false
        },
        {
          username: 'Sara',
          online: true
        },
        {
          username: 'Laura',
          online: true
        }
      ]
    };
  }
  render() {
    //console.log(this.state.users[1].online);
    const usersOnline = this.state.users.filter(user => user.online === true);
    //console.log(usersOnline);
    const renderOnline = usersOnline.map(function(i){
      return <li key={i.username}>{i.username}</li>
    })
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Current Online Users:</h1>
        <ul>{renderOnline}</ul>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

## Render React on the Server with renderToString

So far, you have been rendering React components on the client. Normally, this is what you will always do. However, there are some use cases where it makes sense to render a React component on the server. Since React is a JavaScript view library and you can run JavaScript on the server with Node, this is possible. In fact, React provides a renderToString() method you can use for this purpose.

There are two key reasons why rendering on the server may be used in a real world app. First, without doing this, your React apps would consist of a relatively empty HTML file and a large bundle of JavaScript when it's initially loaded to the browser. This may not be ideal for search engines that are trying to index the content of your pages so people can find you. If you render the initial HTML markup on the server and send this to the client, the initial page load contains all of the page's markup which can be crawled by search engines. Second, this creates a faster initial page load experience because the rendered HTML is smaller than the JavaScript code of the entire app. React will still be able to recognize your app and manage it after the initial load.

```
class App extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return <div/>
  }
};

// Change code below this line

ReactDOMServer.renderToString(<App/>)
```
